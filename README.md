# Piggy_Bank

The program does the following:
- Inserts a coin into a piggybank (using '.insert')
- When shaken it will 'clink' if it contains a coin (using '.shake')
- When shaken it will return no sound if it doesn't contain a coin (using '.shake')
- When smashed it will return the coin if it was inserted (using '.smash')
- When smashed it will not return anything if nothing was inserted (using '.smash')


This is a small exercise for test driven development.
